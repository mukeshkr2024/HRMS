Function Group `Funktionsbereich__c`
Workload

- `Maximum_Workload__c`
- `Minimum_Workload__c`

Clarification Needed:

1. Sort by (Recent/Old The field `ts2__CDate__c` can be used to sort jobs by their creation date (recent or old). Could you confirm if this is the correct field for sorting, or if thereâ€™s another API field we should use?

2. Job Typ We're assuming `Preferred_Job_Type__c` is the correct field for filtering job types. Is this the field you expect to use for filtering by job type, or is `ts2__Job_Type__c` more appropriate?

Not Available in XML for Filter Criteria:

Workplace (On-site/Remote
Shif `Schichtbereitschaft__c`
Commuting Optio `Mobilit_t__c`

Dependencies to Proceed:

1. GitHub Repository Acces We need access to the relevant repository to proceed with development.
2. Craft CMS Integratio We require mapping of the fields listed above to integrate them into the website for easier filtering and sorting of job listings based on the criteria mentioned.

Please confirm a convenient time for a call so we can discuss these queries in detail.
